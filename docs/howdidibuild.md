# How I Built This Project

Author: Ash

This document outlines the steps I took to build the App-DTox project.

## 1. Project Initialization

I started by creating a new React Native project using the React Native CLI. This provided me with the basic structure and dependencies needed for a mobile application.

```bash
npx react-native@latest init App-DTox
```

## 2. Core Development

I then focused on building the core features of the app, which include:

-   **App Usage Tracking:** I implemented the logic to track app usage data. Initially, I used mock data to simulate the tracking functionality.
-   **Data Visualization:** I used the `react-native-chart-kit` library to create line graphs that visualize the app usage data over a 30-day period.
-   **User Interface:** I designed a clean and intuitive user interface using React Native components.

## 3. Documentation

I believe that good documentation is crucial for any project. Therefore, I created the following documents:

-   **README.md:** This file provides a high-level overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.
-   **Prerequisites.md:** This file lists all the necessary dependencies and tools required to run the project.
-   **test.md:** This file provides detailed instructions on how to run the project and its tests.
-   **Technical_Documentation.md:** This file provides a more in-depth explanation of the project's architecture and code.

## 4. Project Structure

I organized the project into the following structure:

-   **`apps/`:** This directory contains the main React Native application.
-   **`docs/`:** This directory contains all the documentation files.

## 5. Version Control

I used Git for version control and GitHub to host the project. This allowed me to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of the project.
